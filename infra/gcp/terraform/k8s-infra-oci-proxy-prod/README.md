## AWS ↔ GCP region pairing and mapping

This document contains the GCP regions that we serve image registries from including future regions.

At a high level:
  - A global GCP loadbalancer routes traffic to the closest Cloud Run service
  - Image Manifests are always fetched from GCP
  - Traffic originating from GCP fetches image blobs from GCP Artifact Registry
  - Traffic originating from AWS fetches image blobs from S3 Buckets
  - Traffic originating from outside of GCP and AWS is fetched from Fastly

| Metro / Country | AWS region | GCP region | Is the GCP region deployed? | Blobs served from GCP to non cloud users? | Active GCP Image Registry | Active S3 Bucket | Nearest Blob Location

Priority Regions:
- P1
    - `af-south-1`. 1st region in Africa
    - `me-central1`. 1st region in the Middle East
    - `asia-east2`. A paired region that will also serve AWS China traffic.
    - `northamerica-northeast1`. First paired region in Canada
- P2 
   - `europe-north2`. A paired region
   - `northamerica-south1` A paired region
   - `asia-southeast1`. A paired region
- Backlog
   - Remaining US regions

Regions we should replace given promoter capacity:
  - `asia-northeast2`, another region of the same country is already active
  - `europe-west10`, another region of the same country is already active

As of 13th of December 2025, all the AWS regions that publicly available have been populated and configured in archeio.
