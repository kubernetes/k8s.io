    # k8s-staging write access for SIG-owned subprojects
    #
    # Each group here represents privileged access to a staging project,
    # allowing the members to directly write to GCS and GCR within the
    # project, as well as trigger Cloud Build within the project. Ideally
    # this level access is used solely for troubleshooting purposes.
    #
    # Membership should correspond roughly to subproject owners for the set of
    # subproject artifacts being stored in a given staging project

    # TODO: where is the bucket? is this prod or staging?
    #
    # Each group here governs access to one GCS bucket. Ideally this level of
    # access is used solely for troubleshooting purposes.
    #
    # Membership should correspond roughly to subproject owners for the set of
    # subproject artifacts being stored in the GCS bucket

    # k8s-infra owners for sig-owned subprojects
    #
    # Each group here represents highly privileged access to kubernetes project
    # infrastructure owned or managed by this SIG. A high level of trust is
    # required for membership in these groups.
    #

    # RBAC groups:
    # - grant access to the `namespace-user` role for a single namespace on the `aaa` cluster
    # - must have WhoCanViewMemberShip: "ALL_MEMBERS_CAN_VIEW"
    # - must be members of gke-security-groups@kubernetes.io
