  # k8s-staging write access for SIG-owned subprojects
  #
  # Each group here represents privileged access to a staging project,
  # allowing the members to directly write to GCS and GCR within the
  # project, as well as trigger Cloud Build within the project. Ideally
  # this level access is used solely for troubleshooting purposes.
  #
  # Membership should correspond roughly to subproject owners for the set of
  # subproject artifacts being stored in a given staging project
