#+TITLE: Becoming a mirror

* Requirements
- at least 1TB of storage (TODO@BobyMCbobs: determine storage requirements)
- the container registry must be publically pull-able without any credentials
- the container registry implementation must be OCI compliant
- one read-only pull account with known basic htpasswd credentials for private pull
- one read-write pull and push account with private basic htpasswd credientials for image distribution
- tests must pass
- no vendor branding on pages related to the mirroring

* Adding your mirror
1. set up your mirror (registry, artifacts)
2. create a PR in /kubernetes/k8s.io/registry.k8s.io/infra/meta/asns/ with:
  - your ASNs (/asns/)
  - your human recognisable vendor name (/name/)
  - domain where registry and artifacts will be redirected to (/redirectsTo/)
  - at least two email contacts (/contacts/)
  - read-only private credentials (/readOnlyPrivateCredentials/)
3. allow time for testing

#+begin_notes
- currently there are no /contacts/, /readOnlyPrivateCredentials/ fields in the ASN yamls
#+end_notes

* Validation
Run the test script against your registry and artifact domains.
The script will:
- perform a /docker pull/ for a container image
- run a cURL against a file in artifacts

#+begin_notes
- doing a pull won't work immediately, without images already existing in the container registry
#+end_notes
