# (Frozen) Legacy Images from gcr.io/google-containers

The images here represent the totality of images in gcr.io/google-containers.
The google-containers GCR is Google-owned, not community-owned. It is being
phased out of service from the community as part of the [Vanity Domain
Flip][VDF].

**As such, these images are effectively FROZEN. New changes to them WILL BE
REJECTED, and any new promotions MUST happen through individual sub-project
staging repos, as detailed in the policy [here][official-policy].**
